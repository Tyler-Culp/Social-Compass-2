# Social-Compass-2
A 6 person project made using Android Studio. This app makes use of a server found at this endpoint: https://socialcompass.goto.ucsd.edu/docs.
The app allows you to add friends by their personal codes and then lets you see them on a compass UI that updates on changes to your friends locations that are pushed
to the server as well as changes to your own location.

The app also allows you to zoom in and out to give you a sense on how close different friends are to you, and also displays your friends name when they are close enough to you
at any zoom point of the compass.
